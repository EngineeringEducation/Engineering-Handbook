# Eng Track 3.0 Release Notes


## Organization Changes
We're behaving like an engineering department, rather than having stratified cohorts. As cohorts come in, they'll be put through an onboarding process, and then jump onto teams. This means your learning experience will be more indivdualized and suited to where you want to go once you leave Tradecraft. This is borne of the renewed focus on StrengthsFinder and the idea that teams are a synthesis of individual's strengths. Rather than focusing on turning what you're weak at into something you're mediocre at, we're going to focus on your personal growth by turning your strengths into superpowers.

## Job Roles
One of the first changes to help us is the introduction of engineering roles. Each of you will have an engineering role, much like a job title, that comes with specific responsibilites and has specific prerequisites. Unlike in every organization however, *_everyone must code_*. These roles should never make you feel like you aren't an engineer _first_.  

So far, we've created these roles:  
* Engineering Lead
* Product Engineering Lead
* Internal Recruitment
* Student-led curriculum manager
* Production Engineer


As time moves on, like in any startup, I'm sure we'll be adding additional roles. We'll be further stratifying these roles and defining them in this repository that you can file pull requests and issues on.  

## Changing roles
To change roles, schedule a 1:2 with Liz and Janardan, and come prepared with concerns with your current role _or_ ideas for your new role.  

## Moving between projects
You will no longer move on from projects all at once in a defined way, but instead will be moved from team to team as priorities change and so as to best serve your learning experience at Tradecraft.  

## Changes to Scrum
Scrum is happening every day, during the first curriculum or self-guided block. Typically this means 9:30 but sometimes will mean 1:00.  
Scrum Diff will be coming out at 7:00, and will be due by 10:00. The questions will remain the same.
Morning standup's questions are changing to the following:  
* Today's intended accomplishments
* What are you anxious about?
* What are you excited about?
* Are you waiting for anything?
* What is your biggest limiting factor today?

## New ways to ask for help
When you ask for help, come prepared with the following:  
* What is the actual problem
* What have you tried
* What did you google?
* What are the error messages you're getting

## Other misc changes
* 1:1s are no longer weekly, but are instead on-demand. Schedule with a track lead to get one.  
* Curriculum will no longer be split, Liz and Janardan will both participate.  
* If no suitable curriculum topics are available, we will have a "work session", where you work and we walk around answering questions.
